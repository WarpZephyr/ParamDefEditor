# ParamDefEditor
This editor allows you to edit, and create paramdefs.  
It can also export them to xml using SoulsFormats internal exporter.  
Exporting the xml back to paramdef is currently broken and does not work.  
Creating fields and indepth editing on more specific things in them is not yet supported, but is planned.
