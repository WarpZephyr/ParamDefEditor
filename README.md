# ParamDefEditor
This editor allows you to edit, and create paramdefs.  
It can also export them to xml using SoulsFormats internal exporter.  
Exporting the xml back to paramdef is currently broken and does not work.  
Creating fields and indepth editing on more specific things in them is not yet supported, but is planned.  

Defs and fields can be copied and pasted as well, and multiple at a time.  
Simply select the entire row by clicking the left side of the DataGridViews beside the first cell.  
Shortcut keys are also supported and mentioned where usable, the context they are used in does matter though.
